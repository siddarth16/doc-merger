# Sample Files

This directory contains sample PDF and DOCX files for testing the Doc Merger application.

## Files (to be added):

1. `sample1.pdf` - A sample PDF document with multiple pages
2. `sample2.pdf` - Another sample PDF document 
3. `document1.docx` - A sample DOCX document
4. `document2.docx` - Another sample DOCX document

## Usage

These files can be used to test:
- PDF to PDF merging
- DOCX to DOCX merging  
- Mixed type merging (when conversion is enabled)
- Page range selection for PDFs
- File reordering and renaming

## Note

In a production environment, you would include actual sample files here. For this demo, the application works with any PDF or DOCX files you upload.
